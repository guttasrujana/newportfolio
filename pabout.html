          <p class="card-text">David decided to become a tour guide back in 2012. He fell in love with travelling, seeing new landscapes, and learning about different cultures in Vietnam. He was born in Ben Tre province in the Mekong Delta but has been living in Ho Chi Minh City since 2005. He was drawn to the capital because of its cosmopolitan culture and a desire to learn new skills in the city.

            His top recommendations for anyone visiting Vietnam would be a visit to Sapa, Hạ Long Bay, or Hội An. His personal favourite spots are Ho Chi Minh City, Củ Chi, and the Mekong Delta areas.</p>
